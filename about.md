This blog mainly consists of topics regarding programming and tooling I personally consider as having the potential to be of public interest. The focus lies on Android and Linux, but I may randomly also write posts about other topics.

The blog has been formerly hosted on [ubuntudroid.blogspot.com](http://ubuntudroid.blogspot.com).
