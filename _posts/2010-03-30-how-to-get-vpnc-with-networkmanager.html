<i>Yesterday I went to university with the brand-new fully updated Ubuntu 10.04 beta installed on my laptop. Connecting to the university wireless network was no problem as expected, but then - shocking moment: vpnc didn't work with the NetworkManager any more! Clicking on the VPN I always use in the university produced an error message saying, that the vpnc plugin couldn't be found.</i><br /><br />Looking at the relevant packages in synaptic I noticed a new package (at least I never had this one installed) called network-manager-vpnc-gnome. After installing it, the vpnc plugin for the NetworkManager reported back for duty.
