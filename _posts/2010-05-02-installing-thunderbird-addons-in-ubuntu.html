<i>Finally I found the time to write a new entry here. Searching for the topic I remembered that I tried to install the "Enigmail" addon for Thunderbird for a rather long time getting always the error message, that the downloaded version was not compatible with my Thunderbird version (fully updated 64bit version).</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />A few days ago I finally found the solution:<br /><br /><ul><li>start Thunderbird as superuser: $ sudo thunderbird</li><li>install the plugin by using the addon-manager</li><li>after a restart of Thunderbird everything should be installed correctly</li></ul>Of course this doesn't only apply to Enigmail, but also to all other plugins. However, if you still got the error message with Enigmail, try to download the current version from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/thunderbird/addon/71">here</a>&nbsp;and install it manually by using the "Install..." button located in the addon-manager window or simply drag'n'drop the downloaded *.xpi file into the (in sudo mode started) Thunderbird window.
