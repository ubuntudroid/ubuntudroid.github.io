Just deployed my first JAX-WS web service with external libraries (SMACK in my case) in Eclipse and discovered, that to get the libraries into the exported WAR one has to add them via Properties-&gt;Deployment Assembly) of the web project. Adding them to exported libraries in the build path view doesn't have the desired effect.<br /><br />Thanks goes to&nbsp;Thorbj√∏rn who answered the question on&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3529690/some-necessary-libraries-are-missing-in-war-file-after-export-from-eclipse-why">Stackoverflow</a>.
