<i>During developing I often use SVN as CVS. However, sometimes when trying to commit I get an error message stating that a specific folder/file is no working copy which leads to a failure of the commit process.</i><br /><br />But don't worry: it is easy to fix in a few steps:<br /><b> </b><br /><ol><li>Create a copy of the affected folder and move it to somewhere outside your working copy.</li><li>Clear the copied folder of all SVN-references (e.g by deleting all <i>.svn</i> folders).</li><li>SVN-delete the affected folder (either be SVN CLI or from the context-menu when using tools like Tortoise/Rabbit-SVN) - if the folder contains subfolders make sure to also SVN-delete these as the SVN-delete command is not recursive.</li><li>Commit the deleted (and only the deleted!) folder.</li><li>Delete the folder from the filesystem.</li><li>Copy the aforementioned copied folder back into the working copy.</li><li>SVN-add the folder.</li><li>Commit.</li></ol>That should make sure, that you're working copy is usable again. Another way would be to just SVN-revert the folder to the last revision, but thus you would loose all changes you've made since the last commit/update.
