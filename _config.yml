  This blog mainly consists of topics regarding programming and tooling I personally
  consider as having the potential to be of public interest. The
  focus lies on Android and Linux, but I may randomly also write posts about other
  topics. The blog has been formerly hosted on ubuntudroid.blogspot.com.
